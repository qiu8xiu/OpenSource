# Trade Credit Market Payment System Balancer

This project implements a system to balance payments in the trade credit market, which is recreating the paper- [*Mathematical Foundations for Balancing the Payment System*](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/14/9/452). 
in the Trade Credit Market It provides a framework for simulating different scenarios and optimizing debt networks among companies.

## Project Structure

- `company.py`: Defines the `Company` and `DebtNetwork` classes for managing (Add, delete, check and change.) companies and their debt relationships.
- `optimizer.py`: Implements for optimizing debt cycles in the network.
- `calculations.py`: Provides various methods for calculating financial metrics and parameters based on the debt network.
- `scenario.py`: Defines different scenarios for initializing the debt network with sample data.
- `visualize.py`: Contains functions for visualizing the debt network.
- `main.py`: The main script to run different scenarios, perform calculations, optimize the network, and visualize the results.


### `bash

python main.py


## Project Explain
- `company.py`:  In this part, [`uuid`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html) (`uuid4`) is used to ensure the universally unique identifiers of the company.
- `optimizer.py`: Using the Liquidity-Saving Mechanisms (LSMs) and implementations similar with TETRIS Core Technologies (TCT) algorithm, there are the logs and implements.
- `calculations.py`:  several key coefficientsï¼š

Nominal Liabilities Matrix (L): Represents the total debts among companies.

Total Debt and Credit: Calculates the total debt and credit for each company.

Net Positions: Computes the net position (total credit minus total debt) for each company.

Net Internal Debt (NID): Calculates the minimum external funding required to clear all debts.

Efficiency Matrix (E): Measures the efficiency of each company's debt relative to their total debt.

Stability Coefficient: Indicates the stability of each company by comparing incoming and outgoing debts.


- `scenario.py`: There is three scenarios used to instantiate and debug.

- `visualize.py`: [`networkx`](https://networkx.org/) is used to visualize the relationship of companies.
- `main.py` main
